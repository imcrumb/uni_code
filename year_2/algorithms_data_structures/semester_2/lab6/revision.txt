What is the difference between an undirected graph and a directed graph?
A directed graph is essentially the same as an undirected graph (in that they are composed
of vertices related to one another by edges) except in a directed graph, the order of the
vertices in the edge is significant.
 
What is a DAG? 
A DAG is a directed acyclic graph. Directed because the order of the vertices of an edge is
significant; and acyclic because the graph contains no cycles.

What is a topological sort of a DAG?
A topological sort of a DAG is an ordered sequence of all vertices in the graph s.t. if two
vertices x and y in the DAG have a directed edge (a,b), then x appears before y in the
sequence
